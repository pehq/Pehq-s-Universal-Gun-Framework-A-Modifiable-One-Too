# Pehq's Universal Gun Framework, A Modifiable One Too

##Set-up

You can simply open the place file in RBLX File

or... 

if that's outdated then you could use Argon to update the place with code from this repository.


# Information
you can say P.A.G.F.A.M.1.2 for short; Pag Fam works too.

The main point of this gun framework is that it aims to meet all conditions in Roblox's sub-genre shooter games

Right now this is a WIP so stuff isn't finished... You could create a pull request if you want to contribute to this project


## Some examples of sub-genres are:

+ Shoot 'em Up - Players could move up, down, left, or right shooting enemies in front of them
+ Shooting Gallery - Players use their mouse to shoot enemies that pops up on their stationary screen
+ Light Gun Shooter - Utilizes devices with gyroscopes to aim and shoot
+ First-Person Shooter (FPS)
+ Third-Person Shooter (TPS)
+ Arena Shooter - Fast movements
+ Hero Shooter - Characters with different abilities depending on who they are and the weapons they're wielding
+ Tactical Shooter - Rewards strategy as well as having *realistic* guns
+ Looter Shooter - Looting on loot to increase odds of survival

These sub-genres are prominant in the game development field. However, Roblox has some sort of cultural background with it leading to new sub-genres usually done en-mass.

## Roblox's Sub-Genres include:
+ Roblox Clanning League (RCL) - It uses laser beams as weapons and requires a team-based effort (hence the name clanning since it's done in organized events)
+ ACS - Guns that uses the ACS gun framework, the reason this counts as a sub-genre is because a lot of games uses acs.
+ Arena Fighters (I call them...) - Start with a base weapon then slowly upgrade stats with buying the next gun. Some variations include having abilities for rewarding kills. Other variations uses PvE.
+ Randomizers - Player gets a random weapon every time they spawn. The weapon comes in many variations with different guis, systems, utilization, etc...
+ Live Action Role-Playing - Focuses on role-playing rather than abilities, an example is reenactment of a military training
+ Musket games - Uses muskets as the main weapon as well as having line battles go on. They're usually made with optimization in mind (using same avatar for lots of players rather than 1 unique avatar) and are organized, being attended by different nations.
+ Tycoons fighters - An army is built in a tycoon to control a point.

With all those sub-genres in mind, if we put it together, there will be many features that needs to be implemented:

FPS, TPS, Point to camera, Gyroscopic support, quick networking, import/export other frameworks, support for different gun structures, PVE, support for different HUD, Allows inheritance of one stats to other guns, etc...
